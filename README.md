# PROJECT OVERVIEW

##  INTRODUCTION

Linear regression is a foundational statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables. When applied to housing prices, linear regression helps to understand how various factors influence the price of homes. This technique is particularly valuable in real estate for predicting property values, assessing market trends, and making informed investment decisions.

## PREPROCESSING

Data preprocessing is an important analytical process that enhances data quality, resolves discrepancies and ensures that data is correct , consistent and reliable. It establishes a solid basis for meaningful examination. Initially it takes the raw data and process it for analysis. The preprocessing steps are as follows:

- **Polynomial Features:** The dataset is split into training and testing for evaluation. The polynomial features transform the original features into higher dimensional space by adding polynomial terms. This allows a linear model to capture non-linear relationship between the features and the target variables.
- **StandardScaler:** StandardScaler standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. This ensures that each feature contributes equally to the model and that the scale of the features does not adversely affect the performance of the model.
- **Ridge Regression**: Ridge regression is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term. This regularization term helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients in the regression model.

## EVALUATION
The model is evaluated by using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure the average squared difference between actual and predicted values,and the R-squared (RÂ²) score to determine the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the features.
